> changes in information technology, far removed from any consideration of its

> a match for the growing bulk and complexity of our ever more self-conscious

> audiences."

This is a hands-on course that introduces students to the intersections of digital history and public history to serve the needs of academic and non-academic audiences. Digital environments such as social media, blogs, exhibits, digital collections and archives, and mobile applications are changing the ways historians interact with their publics. This course introduces theories and methods of digital history and public history, including designing digital exhibits, describing and publishing digital collections, mobile computing, shared authority, and methods for evaluating public history.

To keep our efforts focused, we will apply what we learn to a particular area of historical study: the history of Silicon Valley. We all live, work, and play in this place, and over the past two hundred years the Santa Clara Valley has undergone dramatic environmental, urban, rural, political, social, and economic change. We will explore this history through the creation of a digital history project. We will work with a platform called [Curatescape](http://curatescape.org) in a new public digital history project called [Silicon Valley Historical](http://svhistorical.org). *Silicon Valley Historical* will allow us to build spatially-embedded exhibits on the history of Silicon Valley, drawing on relationships with physical archives in the area. We will produce publicly-accessible exhibits over the course of the quarter. You will present the results of your research during an electronic poster session at the end of the class.
