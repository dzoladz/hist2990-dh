What is digital humanities and what does it offer us? We will investigate how digital humanities can enrich the study of humanistic topics by looking at activities, tools, platforms, and projects. We also will explore the historical underpinnings behind knowledge production on which digital practice depend.

This is a hands-on course that introduces students to the intersections of digital history and public history to serve the needs of academic and non-academic audiences. Digital environments such as social media, blogs, exhibits, digital collections and archives, and mobile applications are changing the ways historians interact with their publics. This course introduces theories and methods of digital history and public history, including designing digital exhibits, describing and publishing digital collections, mobile computing, shared authority, and methods for evaluating public history.

In this course, you will:

- learn the history of post-World War II America
- create historical scholarship using digital tools and resources
- publish historical scholarship on the web

<!--from TO-->This course explores the current and potential impact of digital media on the theory and practice of history. A central thesis behind this syllabus is that digital history is itself an increasingly public endeavor, and as such it makes sense to approach digital history as something very much in sync and in dialog with public history. We will focus on how digital tools and resources are enabling new methods for analysis in traditional print scholarship and the emerging possibilities for new forms of scholarship, public projects, and programs. For the former, we will explore tools for text analysis and visualization and work on interpreting new media forms as primary sources for historical research. For the latter, we will explore a range of new media history resources, including practical work on project management and design. We will read a range of works on designing, interpreting, and understanding digital media. Beyond course readings we will also critically engage a range of digital tools and resources.

This course includes lectures, discussions, and labs that allow students to explore datasets describing geographic, historical, literary, political, civic, and institutional landscapes of Omaha. Students will be using a variety of analytical tools including maps, data visualization, and network science to understand Omaha's history and present. Several sources will be included, such as novels and memoirs that describe the city's experiences. Students will demonstrate their knowledge of the city through discussion and weekly writing, as well as a major project exploring a feature of the city's history.

This course confronts the current and potential influence of digital media on the theory and practice of history. We will focus on resources enabling new forms of scholarship, looking at tools for visualization and text analysis for generating historical interpretations, and explore alternative forms of publishing, design, and research. The course covers a range of readings along with a critical engagement with tools and resources that enable new methods for print scholarship and the possibilities of new forms of scholarship. The course will culminate in the creation of a digital research project.

## Learning Goals

1. Thoughtfully and purposefully engage in dialog about history on the public web with a range of stakeholders in digital history: historians, archivists, museum professionals, educators, and amateurs.
2. Discover, evaluate, and implement digital tools and resources to support emerging and traditional forms of scholarship, public projects, and teaching.
3. Develop proposals for digital history resources with detailed plans for project management, design, outreach, and evaluation.
4. Understand and articulate the key issues in collecting, preserving, and interpreting digital and digitized primary sources from the perspective of a historian.

## A note on communication

You are always welcome to stop by my office hours or arrange for an appointment--just email me with **at least three possible meeting times**. All other communication for this course will happen in the Slack group. If you registered for the course but did not receive an invitation, please [add yourself to the group]() using your UNO email address. You are responsible for all announcements posted to the #general channel. [Here is how to get started with Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users).

If you're writing me an email, bear in mind your tone and audience: emails to your professors shouldn't be like emails to your friends. For help, see this [guide to emailing your professors](http://mleddy.blogspot.com/2005/01/how-to-e-mail-professor.html). I can promise to respond to emails within 48 hours; often I will respond more quickly, but you should not send me an urgent email the night before an assignment is due, for example.

## Overview of assignments

There are no textbooks required for this course, but you will need to sign up for a year's hosting with [Reclaim Hosting](http://reclaimhosting.com). Follow the link and sign up for a student plan. We will go over this in class.

Note that throughout the class you'll be creating a number of small projects on the history of postwar America. Each of these projects will demonstrate a specific skill you learned in class. At the end of the class, you'll combine these into a portfolio of material and present this portfolio at an electronic poster session at Criss Library. **All assignments or blog posts given on Thursday are due before the start of class on Tuesday**.

**Blogging** (20%): For each assignment, you will write a well-argued blog post of around five hundred words using full sentences, paragraphs, and topic sentences. You will be responding to questions in a prompt, but do not simply enumerate the answers. These are graded by completion: thoughtful posts will receive full credit, others will receive no credit.

**Skills assignments** (9 @ 5% each = 45%): You will be creating nine small digital history projects over the course of the semester. You will be selecting a single topic to study and, to the extent that the sources are available, you will focus your assignments on that topic. Except for the Omeka assignment, you will embed these in a page on your website. Due dates and further instructions are listed in the schedule. The assignments break down by: 1. metadata in Omeka; 2. exhibits and storytelling in Omeka; 3. database of records; 4. georeferencing a historical map; 5. mapping data; 6. text mining data; 7. visualizing data; 8. creating a timeline; 9. creating a portfolio of your assignments for the course.

**Midterm exam** (20%): There will be an in-class examination on Tuesday, March 21.

**In class participation** (15%): You are expected to attend each class meeting and actively participate. Bring a laptop and power cord so you can follow along with in class instruction and work on assignments. Bring a copy of any other readings on any day for which they are assigned.

## Required Readings

No extra textbook is required. All of the readings will be online or made available on Canvas.

## Attendance and Participation

Participation is essential to this course, requring active and engaged participation in our activities and discussions. There will be few lectures and we are not building towards a final exam; rather, we're working to build our facilities for thinking critically about the city and analyzing its data. Come to class having completed the readings for the day and be prepared to discuss them. We will assess your reading through course engagement and writing assignments.

This means you must be present not just physically but mentally. I allow you to have **two missed classes without penalty** over the course of the semester. But note that I make no distinction between excused and unexcused absences, so use this allotment wisely. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find out what you missed and make up any assignments. Once beyond your alloted absences, you will receive zero credit for any in-class work or activities missed.

This said, I allow for **one "information overload" day in the semester**. I understand that semesters get hectic, and the reading and workload of this course will be challenging. There might be days where you simply cannot, for any reason, complete the assigned reading. To that end, you can take a single "information overload" day during the semester. On that day, you will not be expected to contribute to class discussion and you will receive a pass on any in-class work. But to take the "information overload" day, you must:

1. You must attend class, listen to any lecture or discussion, and take part in activities or group work not dependent on the day's readings. **Information overload days are not an additional excused absence**.
2. You must inform me before the beginning of class that you will be taking your information overload day. You *may not wait* until I call on you or or you see the day's in-class work. **I will not honor any information overload request made during class**.
3. Take care to be on time if you plan to make an information overload day request, as you won't be allowed to request it if you arrive late.
4. You may not extend information overload day into another class session, even if the readings or activities of one day continue into the next.
5. You may not take an information overload day to avoid completing an assignment.
6. Information overload days will excuse you from any quizzes or reflections, but nothing of more serious import.

At the end of the semester, for any allowed absences or information overload days you *do not use* I will drop your lowest in-class work grade. This means if you attend all sessions prepared and did not require an information overload day, I will drop your three lowest in-class work grades from my final grade calculations.

## Class Requirements

- I expect you to be in class on time and prepared. Please have the reading completed before the meeting of the class. Attendance is up to you: you're adults, but be aware there's a strong correlation between course attendance and final grades. Please make every effort to be here.
- I encourage you to participate in class discussions, to ask questions anytime you feel necessary, and engage with the material. This is the best way for you to get the most out of this course---which is why you're here.
- I expect myself to treat you with respect and courtesy, and I expect you to reciprocate with me and your classmates. I have some specific requirements for that to happen: All cell phones need to be turned off prior to class. *If your phone rings or texts during class, you'll grade will be docked points*. If you're coming in late, please enter quietly and take a seat nearest the door so you don't distract the class.
- I know that emergencies and unforeseen circumstances happen. I will make allowances as you need them, and we will work together to make up any material you might miss if there's a legitimate problem. Missed exams or assignments can only be made up if the absence is excused (illness, grievous loss, emergencies, or official university activity.)

## Digital Devices

### Phones

All phones should be silenced and stowed for the duration of the class. If your phone rings once during class in the semester, we will all laugh at you. If your phone rings again during the semester, I will ask you to leave and count you absent.

Also, you're not as sneaky texting under a table or desk as you think you are.

### Laptops and tablets

This course will rely on access to laptops for almost every session, but laptops also present a temptation to disengage from the class. You cannot use a laptop to follow a game, text, check on your friends latest social media posts, and so forth. These are distractions not only to you, but to those around you as well. If you choose to virtually exit my class, I will ask you to physically leave and mark you as absent. If you seem frequently distracted by what's on your screen, I will ask you to put your laptop away--even for the duration of the semester. I may periodically ask everyone to put their "lids down"--this includes me!--in order to focus our attention on another aspect of the class.

### Technology problems

At some point in the semester, you will undoubtedly have a problem with technology: a laptop will crash, a file will be corrupted, a server will go down, software will not work as expected, and so on. But these aren't emergencies, they're part of living life in the 21st century. Now is as good a time as any to start working on habits to prevent such snafus from halting your work: safe often and early; always keep a backup of your work (ideally, in at least two places). However, virus infections, lost flash drives, lost passwords, corrupted files, and so on is not an emergency. It is your responsibility to take steps to ensure your work will not be lost; or if a device isn't working, to find one that does. **I will not be granting extensions based on problems you may have with a device or internet services you use**. If a problem arises with software we are all using for the course, we will work through them together.

## Academic Dishonesty

Don't cheat. I hold a hard line on this: if you cheat, you're done. That's an F for the course and you will be reported to the University.

## Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).
