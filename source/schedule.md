Since we're spending three hours together once a week, I've set up the schedule into "halves" for each class. We'll meet for roughly an hour and a half, take a fifteen minute break, and reconvene for the remainder of the class. The first half of the class will either revolve around a guest, lecture, or reading discussion. The second half may vary with reading discussion, tool discussion, or getting hands-on with a tool.

Note that readings are due on the date under which they are listed. For example, on September 29 we are discussing public history, so you should spend the week prior completing the readings, assignments, and prior-to-class exercises.
