### Assignments

I may change due dates or assignments. I will always give you plenty of
notice of changes, which will always be intended for your benefit.

Students must satisfactorily complete all assignments (including
participation assignments) in order to pass this course.

### Academic integrity

You are expected to know and follow Stanford University's policies on
academic integrity \<<http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/communitystandards/integrity>\>.

### Course website and privacy

You will have to make an account on WordPress for your online
writing assignments. You may use either your real name or a *nom de
plume* (which I will keep confidential). You retain the copyright to
everything that you write.

### Late work

**Late work will not be accepted.**. If an assignment is late, it is an automatic no credit / zero. 

Exceptions to this policy may (very rarely) be made, but only when there 
are extenuating circumstances such as a personal emergency or an illness 
requiring professional medical attention. These circumstances must be 
documented to my satisfaction and brought to my attention *before* the deadline for an assignment arrives.

### Participation and attendance

Your attendance is expected every day without exception. We will be
working closely in community, so I hope you will develop a good working
relationship with everyone in the class. You should complete readings
and assignments before class each day, and you are expected to actively
participate by listening, questioning, and speaking.

If you must be absent, I request that you notify me by e-mail in advance
of class meeting. Even if you are absent, you must turn in assignments
before the time when our class meets.

After the first two absences from class, the relevant portion of your
grade for the class will be significnatly lowered for each absence.

### Communications

I am always glad to meet with you in person. You can make an appointment
for office hours by e-mailing me. If none of my scheduled office hours
work for you, we can find another time that does. From time to time I
may offer online office hours on Slack.

For all other communications I prefer e-mail \<<jheppler@stanford.edu>\>.
I will reply to your messages in a timely manner (but never on a Sunday). 
**Don't expect an immediate response**. I will follow up with you within twenty-four hours.

I will send official course communications to your Stanford e-mail
address, which you should check regularly.

**I will discuss grades only in person.**

### Electronic devices

Because this is a digital history class you should feel free to bring laptops 
and other devices to work on projects or take and consult notes.  However, if 
I feel laptops and tablets are becoming a distraction you will be asked to put 
them away. I reserve the right to ban laptops and tablets if they become a 
problem.  Except for extraordinary circumstances, I can't see any reason why 
you would need to use a cell phone in class, so please stow phones before 
class begins.

### Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).
