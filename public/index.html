  <div class="post-content">
    <p>What is digital humanities and what does it offer us? We will investigate how digital humanities can enrich the study of humanistic topics by looking at activities, tools, platforms, and projects. We also will explore the historical underpinnings behind knowledge production on which digital practice depend.</p>
<p>This is a hands-on course that introduces students to the intersections of digital history and public history to serve the needs of academic and non-academic audiences. Digital environments such as social media, blogs, exhibits, digital collections and archives, and mobile applications are changing the ways historians interact with their publics. This course introduces theories and methods of digital history and public history, including designing digital exhibits, describing and publishing digital collections, mobile computing, shared authority, and methods for evaluating public history.</p>
<p>In this course, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn the history of post-World War II America</li>
<li>create historical scholarship using digital tools and resources</li>
<li>publish historical scholarship on the web</li>
</ul>
<!--from TO-->
<p>This course explores the current and potential impact of digital media on the theory and practice of history. A central thesis behind this syllabus is that digital history is itself an increasingly public endeavor, and as such it makes sense to approach digital history as something very much in sync and in dialog with public history. We will focus on how digital tools and resources are enabling new methods for analysis in traditional print scholarship and the emerging possibilities for new forms of scholarship, public projects, and programs. For the former, we will explore tools for text analysis and visualization and work on interpreting new media forms as primary sources for historical research. For the latter, we will explore a range of new media history resources, including practical work on project management and design. We will read a range of works on designing, interpreting, and understanding digital media. Beyond course readings we will also critically engage a range of digital tools and resources.</p>
<!-- description
This course confronts the current and potential influence of digital media on the theory and practice of history. We will focus on resources enabling new forms of scholarship, looking at tools for visualization and text analysis for generating historical interpretations, and explore alternative forms of publishing, design, and research. The course covers a range of readings along with a critical engagement with tools and resources that enable new methods for print scholarship and the possibilities of new forms of scholarship. The course will culminate in the creation of a digital research project.
-->
<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Thoughtfully and purposefully engage in dialog about history on the public web with a range of stakeholders in digital history: historians, archivists, museum professionals, educators, and amateurs.</li>
<li>Discover, evaluate, and implement digital tools and resources to support emerging and traditional forms of scholarship, public projects, and teaching.</li>
<li>Develop proposals for digital history resources with detailed plans for project management, design, outreach, and evaluation.</li>
<li>Understand and articulate the key issues in collecting, preserving, and interpreting digital and digitized primary sources from the perspective of a historian.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-note-on-communication">A note on communication</h2>
<p>You are always welcome to stop by my office hours or arrange for an appointment. All other communication for this course will happen in the Slack group. If you registered for the course but did not receive an invitation, please <a href="">add yourself to the group</a> using your UNO email address. You are responsible for all announcements posted to the #general channel. <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users">Here is how to get started with Slack</a>.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-assignments">Overview of assignments</h2>
<p>There are no textbooks required for this course, but you will need to sign up for a year’s hosting with <a href="http://reclaimhosting.com">Reclaim Hosting</a>. Follow the link and sign up for a student plan. We will go over this in class.</p>
<p>Note that throughout the class you’ll be creating a number of small projects on the history of postwar America. Each of these projects will demonstrate a specific skill you learned in class. At the end of the class, you’ll combine these into a portfolio of material and present this portfolio at an electronic poster session at Criss Library. <strong>All assignments or blog posts given on Thursday are due before the start of class on Tuesday</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Blogging</strong> (20%): For each assignment, you will write a well-argued blog post of around five hundred words using full sentences, paragraphs, and topic sentences. You will be responding to questions in a prompt, but do not simply enumerate the answers. These are graded by completion: thoughtful posts will receive full credit, others will receive no credit.</p>
<p><strong>Skills assignments</strong> (9 @ 5% each = 45%): You will be creating nine small digital history projects over the course of the semester. You will be selecting a single topic to study and, to the extent that the sources are available, you will focus your assignments on that topic. Except for the Omeka assignment, you will embed these in a page on your website. Due dates and further instructions are listed in the schedule. The assignments break down by: 1. metadata in Omeka; 2. exhibits and storytelling in Omeka; 3. database of records; 4. georeferencing a historical map; 5. mapping data; 6. text mining data; 7. visualizing data; 8. creating a timeline; 9. creating a portfolio of your assignments for the course.</p>
<p><strong>Midterm exam</strong> (20%): There will be an in-class examination on Tuesday, March 21.</p>
<p><strong>In class participation</strong> (15%): You are expected to attend each class meeting and actively participate. Bring a laptop and power cord so you can follow along with in class instruction and work on assignments. Bring a copy of any other readings on any day for which they are assigned.</p>
<h2 id="required-readings">Required Readings</h2>
<p>No extra textbook is required. All of the readings will be online or made available on Canvas.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>You’re adults. You’re not required to be in my class. But if you’d rather not be in my class, you might as well drop the class now. Students should be wary of skipping classes. Simply looking at the data, there’s a clear correlation between the number of classes attended for the semester and a student’s final grade. <em>Attend class</em>.</p>
<h2 id="class-requirements">Class Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>I expect you to be in class on time and prepared. Please have the reading completed before the meeting of the class. Attendance is up to you: you’re adults, but be aware there’s a strong correlation between course attendance and final grades. Please make every effort to be here.</li>
<li>I encourage you to participate in class discussions, to ask questions anytime you feel necessary, and engage with the material. This is the best way for you to get the most out of this course—which is why you’re here.</li>
<li>I expect myself to treat you with respect and courtesy, and I expect you to reciprocate with me and your classmates. I have some specific requirements for that to happen: All cell phones need to be turned off prior to class. <em>If your phone rings or texts during class, you’ll grade will be docked points</em>. If you’re coming in late, please enter quietly and take a seat nearest the door so you don’t distract the class.</li>
<li>I know that emergencies and unforeseen circumstances happen. I will make allowances as you need them, and we will work together to make up any material you might miss if there’s a legitimate problem. Missed exams or assignments can only be made up if the absence is excused (illness, grievous loss, emergencies, or official university activity.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>Don’t cheat. I hold a hard line on this: if you cheat, you’re done. That’s an F for the course and you will be reported to the University.</p>
